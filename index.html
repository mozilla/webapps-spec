    This document specifies a JSON based format to describe installable web
    applications. In addition, a set of JavaScript APIs are described that
    allow web content to trigger installation of such applications, as well as
    manage them on behalf of the user.

    <h2>App Manifest</h2>

    <p>An application <dfn>manifest</dfn> is a JSON file describing an
    installable web application. This JSON file consists of a top-level object
    and several properties.</p>

      <h2>Properties</h2>

      <p class="note">All leaf properties MUST contain string values.</p>

      <section>
      <h3>Mandatory Properties</h3>

      <ul class="properties">
        <li><dfn id="propdef-name">name</dfn>: The name of the web application
        in the default locale. Maximum length is 128 characters.</li>

        <li><dfn id="propdef-description">description</dfn>: A short
        description of the web application in the default locale. Maximum
        length is 1024 characters.</li>

        <li><dfn id="propdef-default_locale">default_locale</dfn>: <i>Mandatory
        only if "locales" property is set</i>. The locale of the top-level name
        and description.</li>
      </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
      <h3>Optional Properties</h3>

      <ul class="properties">
        <li><dfn id="propdef-launch_path">launch_path</dfn>: The path within
        the web application's origin that is loaded when the application is
        launched.</li>

        <li><dfn id="propdef-icons">icons</dfn>: A map of icon sizes to URIs of
        the icons (which may be absolute, relative or data URIs). Icons MUST be
        square. Paths beginning with "<code>/</code>" are treated as relative
        to the origin of the app.</li>

        <li>
          <dfn id="propdef-type">type</dfn>: Determines how this app and the
          manifest will be verified by the runtime, and what security policy
          will apply. See <a href=
          "https://wiki.mozilla.org/Apps/Security#Types_of_applications">types
          of applications</a>, for a more detailed description. The value for
          this property MUST be one of the following:

          <ul>
            <li>
              <dfn id="propdef-type-web">web</dfn>: A regular web app, may be
              self hosted or distributed by an app store. All permissions are
              opt-in at install and runtime, limited to permissions enumerated
              in the manifest. If the <a>type</a> property is not specified,
              this will be the default value.
            </li>

            <li><dfn id="propdef-type-privileged">privileged</dfn>: An
            authenticated application approved by an app store. Equivalent in
            functionality and security to apps on other mobile platforms, but
            is required to be approved by an app store after a code review or
            some equivalent risk management process. At install, app assets are
            verified &amp; remain stored locally in a package. Requires a
            Content Security Policy, and all explicit permissions are requested
            at runtime, showing user the app's data usage intentions, and
            persisted by default.</li>

            <li><dfn id="propdef-type-certified">certified</dfn>: This category
            is reserved for apps that require approval by a device vendor or
            equivalent party due to risk of device corruption or risk to
            critical functionality. These include apps such as the system
            settings app, default dialer (to ensure emergency services are
            always accessible), core radio and power management, etc. Not
            intended for 3rd party applications.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <dfn id="propdef-developer">developer</dfn>: Information about the
          developer of the application, suitable for display.

          <ul>
            <li><dfn id="propdef-developer-name">name</dfn>: The name of the
            developer.</li>

            <li><dfn id="propdef-url">url</dfn>: A URL pointing to the
            developer's website</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <dfn id="propdef-locales">locales</dfn>: A map of locale specific
          overrides of data contained in the manifest. Each locale key is keyed
          on a locale tag [RFC4646], and contains a sparse representation of
          the manifest. Any field in the <a>locales</a> property will override
          the corresponding property in the manifest. The <a>locales</a>,
          <a>installs_allowed_from</a>, and <a>default_locale</a> CANNOT be
          overridden. If the <a>locales</a> property is set, the
          <a>default_locale</a> MUST also be set.
        </li>

        <li><dfn id=
        "propdef-installs_allowed_from">installs_allowed_from</dfn>: An array
        of origins that are allowed to trigger installation of this
        application. This field allows the developer to restrict installation
        of their application to specific sites. If the value is omitted,
        installs are allowed from any site.</li>

        <li>
          <dfn id="propdef-appcache_path">appcache_path</dfn>: The absolute
          path to the application cache (<a href=
          "http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/offline.html#appcache">AppCache</a>)
          manifest. When an app is installed, the AppCache manifest will be
          fetched and parsed, and its static assets under the CACHE header will
          be cached.
        </li>

        <li><dfn id="propdef-version">version</dfn>: A string that represents
        the version of this manifest. The User-Agent does not interpret this
        value in any way and is opqaue to everyone but the application itself.
        The field is provided to help the developer deal with various update
        cases, which will be discussed in following sections.</li>

        <li><dfn id="propdef-screen_size">screen_size</dfn>: This object may
        contain the <code>min_height</code> and <code>min_width</code>
        properties that describe the minimum height and width (in pixels) the
        application needs in order to render correctly. Interpretation of these
        values is left up to the runtime and/or app store.</li>

        <li><dfn id="propdef-required_features">required_features</dfn>: This
        array consists of a set of values that describes the mandatory features
        the application needs in order to run correctly. A full list of valid
        values is TBD.</li>

        <li>
          <dfn id="propdef-orientation">orientation</dfn>: This value defines
          the allowed orientations at which the application may be rendered. If
          a value is provided, the runtime MUST ensure that the viewport
          rendering the application will adhere to one of the specified values
          and never orient the application in a direction not specified in this
          property. The default behavior SHOULD be to rotate the viewport at an
          angle that best fits the orientation of the device, and MUST change
          as the user spatially rotates the device. The value MUST be an
          array containing one or more of the following string values
          (duplicates SHOULD be ignored):

          <ul>
            <li><dfn id=
            "propdef-orientation-portrait-primary">portrait-primary</dfn>:
            Locked to a single portrait direction. If the device has an obvious
            primary orientation in portrait mode, this is that orientation. If
            there is no obvious primary orientation due to landscape being the
            primary orientation for the device, this is the orientation if
            rotating the device 90 degrees clock-wise from the primary
            landscape mode.</li>

            <li><dfn id=
            "propdef-orientation-landscape-primary">landscape-primary</dfn>:
            Locked to a single landscape direction. If the device has an
            obvious primary orientation in landscape mode, this is that
            orientation. If there is no obvious landscape orientation due to
            portrait being the primary orientation for the device, this is the
            orientation if rotating the device 90 degrees clock-wise from the
            primary portrait mode.</li>

            <li>
              <dfn id=
              "propdef-orientation-portrait-secondary">portrait-secondary</dfn>:
              The portrait mode opposite of <a>portrait-primary</a>.
            </li>

            <li>
              <dfn id=
              "propdef-orientation-landscape-secondary">landscape-secondary</dfn>:
              The landscape mode opposite of <a>landscape-primary</a>.
            </li>

            <li><dfn id="propdef-orientation-portrait">portrait</dfn>:
            Equivalent to
            <code>["portrait-primary", "portrait-secondary"]</code>.</li>

            <li><dfn id="propdef-orientation-landscape">landscape</dfn>:
            Equivalent to
            <code>["landscape-primary", "landscape-secondary"]</code>.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li><dfn id="propdef-permisssions">permissions</dfn>: This value
        consists of a set of permissions that the application needs. An
        application MUST list every API that is considered to require user
        permission in this field. Usage of an API without a corresponding
        entry in the manifest will fail. The field is an object, with each
        property name specifying a single permission, and object containing
        the following fields:

          <ul>
            <li>
              <dfn id="propdef-permissions-desc">description</dfn>: Contains
              a human readable string specifying the intent behind requesting
              use of this API. This property is mandatory.
            </li>
            <li>
              <dfn id="propdef-permissions-access">access</dfn>: Contains a
              a string specifying the type of access required for this
              permission. This field is mandatory for a certain subset of
              permissions, and MUST be one of <dfn>read</dfn>,
              <dfn>readwrite</dfn>, <dfn>readcreate</dfn>, or
              <dfn>createonly</dfn>.
            </li>
          </ul>

        The following table lists the various permissions, and whether
        they require an <a>access</a> property.

        the runtime should launch the application in fullscreen mode.</li>

        <li><dfn id="propdef-activities">activities</dfn>: This value specifies
        a set of
        <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI/WebActivities">WebActivities</a>
        that this app supports. Each property in this value is a discrete
        activity whose name matches the property name. Activity names are
        free-form text, and each activity is represented by an object. This
        object MUST contain the following property:

        <ul>
          <li><dfn id="propdef-activities-href">href</dfn>: When another app
          or web page initiates an activity that is supported by this app, if
          this app is chosen to perform the activity, this page will be opened

              supports and subsequently execute the activity for which it
              receives a message. Further, if the activity requires a return
              value, the page MUST call <code>activity.postResult</code> or
              <code>activity.postError</code> (where <code>activity</code> is
              the first argument provided to the function specified by
              <code>setMessageHandler</code>) as appropriate. These functions
              are specified in greater details in the WebActivities
              document.</li>

              The page handling the activity will open in an overlay (on a
              mobile device, for example, this will be rendered in a popup over
              the original app that requested the activity). Subsequent behavior
              is exactly the same as if the disposition were
              <dfn>window</dfn>.</li>

          specified a particular filter. These filters will be applied while
          determining apps suitable for handling a given activity. Filter names
          are free-form text, but their values MUST be either a string or an
          array of strings (the exact type depends on the filter).</li>

      <h2>Serving Manifests</h2>

      <p>An application manifest MUST be served from the same origin that the
      application itself is served from. There MUST only be one application per
      origin.</p>

      <p>When served as a static file, it is RECOMMENDED that the manifest be
      stored with the extension <code>.webapp</code>. The manifest MUST be
      served with a <code>Content-Type</code> header of
      <code>application/x-web-app-manifest+json</code>. It is RECOMMENDED that
      manifests be served over SSL.</p>
