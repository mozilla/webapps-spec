      This document specifies a JSON based format to describe installable web applications. In addition,
      a set of JavaScript APIs are described that allow web content to trigger installation of such
      applications, as well as manage them on behalf of the user.

      <h2>App Manifest</h2>
      <p>
        An application <dfn>manifest</dfn> is a JSON file describing an installable web application.
        This JSON file consists of a top-level object and several properties.
      </p>

      <section>

        <h2>Properties</h2>

        <h3>Mandatory Properties</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><dfn>name</dfn>:
            The name of the web application in the default locale.
            Maximum length is 128 characters.
          </li>
          <li><dfn>description</dfn>:
            A short description of the web application in the default locale.
            Maximum length is 1024 characters.
          </li>
          <li><dfn>default_locale</dfn>:
            [Mandatory only if "locales" property is set]. The locale of the
            top-level name and description.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Optional Properties</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><dfn>launch_path</dfn>:
            The path within the web application's origin that is loaded
            when the application is launched
          </li>
          <li><dfn>icons</dfn>:
            A map of icon sizes to URIs of the icons (which may be absolute or data URIs).
            Icons MUST be square.
          </li>
          <li><dfn>developer</dfn>:
            Information about the developer of the application, suitable for display.
            <ul>
              <li><dfn>name</dfn>: The name of the developer.</li>
              <li><dfn>url</dfn>: A URL pointing to the developer's website</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><dfn>locales</dfn>:
            A map of locale specific overrides of data contained in the manifest. Each
            locale key is keyed on a locale tag [RFC4646], and contains a sparse
            representation of the manifest. Any field in the <a>locales</a> property
            will override the corresponding property in the manifest. The <a>locales</a>,
            <a>installs_allowed_from</a>, and <a>default_locale</a> CANNOT be overridden.
            If the <a>locales</a> property is set, the <a>default_locale</a> MUST also be
            set.
          </li>
          <li><dfn>installs_allowed_from</dfn>:
            An array of origins that are allowed to trigger installation of this application.
            This field allows the developer to restrict installation of their application to
            specific sites. If the value is omitted, installs are allowed from any site.
          </li>
          <li><dfn>version</dfn>:
            A string that represents the version of this manifest. The User-Agent does
            not interpret this value in any way and is opqaue to everyone but the
            application itself. The field is provided to help the developer deal
            with various update cases, which will be discussed in following sections.
          </li>
          <li><dfn>screen_size</dfn>:
            This object may contain the <code>min_height</code> and <code>min_width</code>
            properties that describe the minimum height and width (in pixels) the application
            needs in order to render correctly. Interpretation of these values is left up
            to the runtime and/or app store.
          </li>
          <li><dfn>required_features</dfn>:
            This array consists of a set of values that describes the mandatory features the
            application needs in order to run correctly. A full list of valid values is TBD.
          </li>
          <li><dfn>orientation</dfn>:
            This value defines the orientation at which the application will initially start.
            Can be one of "portrait", "landscape", "portrait-secondary" or "landscape-secondary".
            The options suffixed with "-secondary" imply a 180 degree rotation from the options
            without the suffix, for instance, holding the phone upside down (but
            still in a manner where width &lt; height), implies the "portrait-secondary" 
            orientation. If this field had a valid value, the runtime will not change the orientation
            of the view rendering the application even if the device is turned.
          </li>
          <li><dfn>fullscreen</dfn>:
            This value is set to "true" or "false" to describe whether the runtime should
            launch the application in fullscreen mode.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Serving Manifests</h2>
        <p>
          An application manifest MUST be served from the same origin that the application
          itself is served from.
        </p>
        <p>
          When served as a static file, it is RECOMMENDED that the manifest be stored
          with the extension <code>.webapp</code>. The manifest MUST be served with a
          <code>Content-Type</code> header of <code>application/x-web-app-manifest+json</code>.
          It is RECOMMENDED that manifests be served over SSL.

      <h2>Application Records</h2>
      <section>

      <h2>Application Registry</h2>
      <section>
        <p>
          A privileged caller is a web page that has been explicitely authorized by the user to manage
          applications on their behalf. Such privileged origins also have access to the AppRegistry
          interface as described below.
        </p>

          <dt>EventTarget install(in DOMString manifestUrl, [Optional] in Object parameters)</dt>
          <dd>
            Triggers the installation of an application as specified by the manifest at
            <code>manifestUrl</code>. The User-Agent must fetch the manifest from the provided
            URL, verify that it is valid, and then ask for permission from the user to allow
            installation to proceed. The User-Agent must also persist the parameters provided
            (if any) which may later be retrived from the <code>AppObject</code> representing
            this application. The user may choose to whitelist certain origins to allow them
            to install applications without any permission prompts.
          </dd>
          <dt>EventTarget getSelf()</dt>
          <dd>
            Retrieves the application record for the origin from which the call is made.
          </dd>
          <dt>EventTarget getInstalled()</dt>
          <dd>

            installed. The only argument to this function will be the <code>AppObject</code> of the
            applicatio that was installed. <em>This attribute can be set by priveleged callers only.</em>

          Most of the methods described above return an <code>EventTarget</code> object to which
          success and error handlers may be attached using standard DOM methods like <code>addEventListener</code>
          or attributes like <code>onsuccess</code> and <code>onerror</code>.
